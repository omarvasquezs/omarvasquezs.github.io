            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I have over 9+ years of experience in the field of IT technical support and helpdesk in different IT
                peruvian outsourcing companies such as Cosapi Data, IBT Group, and Stefanini IT Solutions, backed by 3
                additional years as a web developer at Plan Left LLC, a digital marketing
                agency that specializes in creating and managing e-commerce solutions for small and medium businesses,
                and 3 months in Vardot, a company that provides web solutions using Drupal in most of their projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                My competencies also include customer service, problem-solving, and even
                project management in some of my freelance projects. I have developed and maintained websites in
                Wordpress, Drupal,
                and programmed custom
                web applications using PHP frameworks such as Laravel, and CodeIgniter 2, 3 and 4 + GroceryCRUD,
                alongside server-side
                enhancements with Node.js. Additionally, I'm adept at compiling assets with Laravel Mix and have
                experience in developing custom themes for Bigcommerce using the Stencil CLI tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my previous job experiences, I have handled tickets and reports using different ticketing systems
                such as
                Aranda, BakerAssyst, CA ServiceDesk, Jira, Remedy, ServiceNow and solarwinds web help desk. My expertise
                spans across a variety of technologies and
                methodologies such as ITIL, kanban and scrum, allowing me to deliver high-quality solutions to the
                unique needs
                of each
                project. Additionally, I have demonstrated my skills and knowledge in IT service management by obtaining
                the ITIL4 Foundation certification. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly web applications
                that exceed the expectations of clients and users alike.
